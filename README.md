# PersonalWebsite-JiaweiQi
 

The link for deployment is https://personalwebsite-jiaweiqi.netlify.app/. The website is fully responsive for every device.

Instead of the tradtional way to show up directly, my landing page(index.html) is a multiple choice. To protect my data privacy, only the visitors who know my last name are allowed to enter the main page website(or the cheating way is to inspect my source code). There is one function in JavaScript, make sure document can go on next page, if the user pick the correct choice.

There is a navigation bar on header to navigate the visitors. The bar is user-friendly and interactive, and the color is a wonderful design on this page, while the position is fixed during the entire time to make sure the scrolling process is as smooth as possible. The interactive effect on each element on this bar which is coded in Jquery creates a fancy animation for visitors.

There are a bunch of internal links, as the first "verification" page is the most impressive one. The followings are three links on the nav bar, and the internal link to my resume file. Four external links are on the Contact page. Visitor can contact me through email, snapchat, Linkedin, and github. One HTML table for my personal Q&As, include all my favorites, which help the vistors to know me better.
